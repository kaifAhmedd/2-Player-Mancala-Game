| We first choose a pit with 1 stone and if the pit after is 0.  If it's 0 then we take the corresponding stones in the opposite pit  and check if that equals the stones captured. We also check if the pit  that triggered the capture and the pit that the stones got captured from  have been emptied | assertEquals(0,pit4Count) assertEquals(0,pit8Count) assertEquals(4,capturedStones)                           | True            |   |
| We distribute stones starting at pit 1 to check if the other pits have the  number of stones they are expected to have as well as the stones in the stores.                                                                                                                                             | assertEquals(0,pit1) assertEquals(5,pit2) assertEquals(4,pit6) assertEquals(0,store1) assertEquals(0,store2) | True            |   |
| Checks if the number of stones is 0 after we remove  stones from the pit (we will test pit 4)                                                                                                                                                                                                           | assertEquals(0,numberOfStones)                                                                               | True            |   |
| Checks if number of stones at a pit is 4 after a board reset  (we will test pit 1)                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | assertEquals(4,numberOfStones)                                                                               | True            |   |
| Checks if side isn’t empty by adding stones to the pits(pits 1-6)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | isSideEmpty(3) assertEquals(false,checker);                                                                  | False           |   |
| Checks if side is empty by first removing the stones from the pits(pits 7-12)                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | isSideEmpty(8) assertEquals(true,checker);                                                                   | True            |   |
| Checks if board has been reset by checking if both stores are empty                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Compare the sum of the two stores to 0 to see  if the board has been reset. assertEquals(0, sumOfStores)     | True            |   |
| Checks if player is registered to correct owner                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Player1 name should be equal to registered  player one  assertEquals(“Player1”, playerName)                  | True            |   |
